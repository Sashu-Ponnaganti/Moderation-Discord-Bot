Description:
Hi, my name is Sasanka Ponnaganti and I am a computer science student at the University of Maryland.

I created a discord bot that mainly serves to help server owners and admins in moderating their server. It also contains some other fun and helpful features.

Using this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1013583202209763460&permissions=8&scope=bot
Anyone can add my bot to their server and enjoy the great features!

In terms of moderation, my bot has a slowdown feature that applies to the server. This feature makes it so that server members can send messages only in time intervals set by an admin. The bot can also lockdown channels in a server, preventing server members from sending any messages at all until the admin uses the unlock command, reversing the lockdown.

There are also some other commands such as the changename command which allows users to use the bot to change their server nickname.
There is also a poll command that users can use to post a poll in the server that which other members can use the reaction emojis to vote on.
Additionally, there is a time command that sends the current date and time. There is also a weather command that allows users to type the weather command followed by a city name and the bot responds with the current weather statistics of that area.

For fun, there is also a hello command that the bot responds back with "hello".


I hope you enjoy my bot!

Files:
There is one python file labeled finalproject.py which contains all the code used to run the bot. The bot can be brought online by running the code and there is a command line message letting you know that the bot is running smoothly.

Design Choices:
Coding this bot took a lot of trial and error. It was tough thinking about new commands to add and how I would implement them successfully. Certain ideas were initially developed but scrapped later on due to too many problems. Understanding the APIs that I was using took a lot of effort and helped me learn how coding is an infinitely collaborative process among programmers across the world. Learning how these APIs worked honestly felt like learning a whole new programming language and it was fun getting to figure them out.

Final Thoughts: I started CS50 in the summer and had to take a break from the course before finishing this final project as I was starting my first semester of college in late August. After finishing it now while also starting my Object Oriented Programming class in Java at UMD, I can say CS50 is one of the best designed and most helpful courses I have taken. I highly recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested in computer science or programming. I think my bot could definitely benefit from some more features and I will probably add on to it in the future on my own. It was super fun to use my new programming skills to create something practical in a service that I use all the time in discord. This was a fantastic learning experience and I have come out of this final project with a much greater understanding of what it takes to create a coding project on my own.
